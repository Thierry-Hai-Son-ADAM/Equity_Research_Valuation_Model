# Equity_Research_Valuation_Model
This project is a Python Colab pipeline for stock valuation. It fetches historical prices and financials via yfinance and FRED, computes Beta, market risk premium, CAPM cost of equity, cost of debt and WACC, retrieves and forecasts free cash flows, runs DCF and DDM models, compares EV/EBITDA and P/E multiples, and plots results.
